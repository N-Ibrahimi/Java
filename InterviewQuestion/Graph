Question -  Given a directed graph check whether the a path exists between 2 vertices or 2 nodes.

O(N)-  Implementation.

Basic idea -  Since it is a directed graph so we only need to check that particular row of the first Vertex and the rest of
the columns of the same row. If there is one for that particular location or column than there is a path for the mentioned 
nodes.
